## Usage

To get started with MeanFlow, you can run the following example script:

```bash
python examples/example.py
```

This script demonstrates the basic functionality of MeanFlow. You can modify the parameters in the script to experiment with different settings.

### Configuration

MeanFlow allows you to configure various parameters in your experiments. You can set the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the configuration file. Here is an example of a configuration file:

```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.001,
  "batch_size": 64,
  "epochs": 100
}
```

Simply modify the values to suit your needs.
